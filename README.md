## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY FOR USE AS LEARNING MATERIAL

This project is meant for programmers experience in some other language to put together the basic concepts of Haskell.

This project assumes knowledge of:
- git (how to clone a repo)
- A text editor with Haskell supported ([Atom](https://atom.io/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Vim](https://vim.sourceforge.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

By the end of the project you'll have experience with:
- Basic arithmetic
- Basics of using stack (To build and test your code)
- Case statements and Pattern Matching
- Control flow with booleans
- Currying
- Define functions
- Defining your own types
- Function composition
- Lambdas
- Lists
- Printing to the console
- Reading user input from the console
- Representing Failure with Maybe
- Type Signatures
